# MP3 MelodyFlow 
  MP3 MelodyFlow is a robust and feature-rich MP3 player application developed using Flutter and Kotlin. This app offers an exceptional audio experience with advanced features like media controls, foreground notification, and favorites management.

## How It Works
1. **MP3 Reading**: Kotlin coroutines are used to read MP3 files asynchronously.
2. **Audio Playback**: The MP3 files are passed to Flutter, where the Audio Player package handles the playback.
3. **Foreground Notification**: The audio information is passed back to Kotlin, which starts a foreground notification with media controls.
4. **Favorites**: Users can save their favorite tracks using the SQFlite package in Flutter.
5. **Splash Screen & App Icon**: Custom splash screen and app icon are implemented directly in the Android the right way without the use of a package.

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: For the UI and overall app structure.
- **Kotlin**: For handling background tasks and integrating with Android-specific features.
- **Coroutines**: For efficient background processing in Kotlin.
- **Audio Player Package**: For playing audio files within Flutter.
- **SQFlite**: For managing favorites and local storage.
